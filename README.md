# The Kitty

> **Build a working economy with people you trust.** Pool CRC in a tontine or group pot, then spend it on services your circle offers — on Circles.

## What it is

**The Kitty turns a Circles trust circle into a working local economy.** Two halves that feed each other: a **services board** where humans publish what they offer in CRC — a haircut, a lesson, a brunch — and **tontines + group pots** where a few people pool CRC and take turns spending it on each other. Every payout lands back inside the trust graph.

The pooling side is the model behind tandas, sou-sou, hui, and tontines — used by hundreds of millions of people globally — rewritten as a Circles V2 mini-app: a real BaseGroup avatar plus a governance contract that enforces the rotation deterministically by member index.

The two pool modes — **rotating tontine** (one member claims the pot each round) and **free pot** (shared treasury with a small-spend cap + quorum vote) — share the same contract, the same primitives, only the payout rule differs.

## How it works

### Services board

1. **Publish what you offer in CRC** — a haircut, a guitar lesson, a brunch. One signature, one row in the `ServiceRegistry`. You can edit price/description or deactivate at any time from `/services/mine`.
2. **Browse and pay** — anyone can see every active listing, with provider avatar, 1–5 star rating, and trust-graph status. Tapping *Pay* bundles **trust + Hub.safeTransferFrom + logPayment** in a single host signature, so one tap is one atomic bundle on-chain.
3. **Rate** — after a payment, the buyer can rate 1–5. Per-rater overwrite semantics, no anonymous spam.

### Funding (kitties)

1. **Start a kitty** with 2+ Circles members. Pick *rotating tontine* (round length + per-member contribution) or *free pot* (quorum + small-spend cap).
2. **Deposit CRC** — each member commits their share; deposits are tracked on-chain per address.
3. **Pay out** —
   - *Tontine*: when a round opens, the current member calls `claimRound` and receives the full pot. Rotation advances by one.
   - *Free pot*: under the cap → any member pays direct, no vote. Over the cap → propose → approve → execute once quorum is met.

Both halves feed each other: a kitty payout lands back in the trust circle, and the spending happens on a service the same circle offers.

## Why on-chain

- **No trésorier.** No member holds the pool on behalf of the others. The contract is the custodian; the rules of payout are public Solidity, not a Telegram agreement.
- **Anti-rug ROSCA.** The historical failure mode of tontines is the organizer disappearing with the round. With `claimRound` deterministic by member index, the rotation can't be subverted by whoever happens to manage the group chat.
- **Auditable.** Every contribution and every payout is a transaction on Gnosis Chain. The dispute log is the chain itself.
- **Built on Circles humans.** Members are Circles V2 verified humans linked by the trust graph — the same anti-sybil layer that backs CRC itself.

```

- `ServiceRegistry.sol` — singleton catalog: services priced in CRC, with `logPayment` aggregates (payments + total CRC paid) and per-rater 1–5 star ratings. Holds no funds — the actual CRC transfer goes through `Hub.safeTransferFrom`.
- `KittyGovernance.sol` — pool custodian. Runs free-pot governance (`propose / approve / execute / smallSpend`) and, when `tontineMode` is enabled, the rotating `claimRound` payout. The two modes co-exist on the same contract.
- `KittyFactory.sol` — one-tx setup: creates the BaseGroup, trusts members, deploys governance with the chosen mode + parameters, hands BaseGroup ownership back to the creator.
- `MiniappRunner` (front-end, in-tree) — implements `@aboutcircles/sdk-runner`'s `ContractRunner` against the Circles miniapp iframe host, so the rest of the front uses typed SDK wrappers (`core.hubV2.*`) instead of hand-rolled calldata. **Upstream PR package** ready under [`docs/upstream-pr/sdk-runner-miniapp/`](docs/upstream-pr/sdk-runner-miniapp/) — aligns with the existing `SafeBrowserRunner` shape (static `create()`, `RunnerError` patterns, viem `TransactionReceipt` returns) and is opened against `aboutcircles/sdk`.

## Deployed (Gnosis Chain, chainId 100)

- ServiceRegistry: [`0x26F81d723Ad1648194FAA4b7E235105Fd1212c6c`](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x26F81d723Ad1648194FAA4b7E235105Fd1212c6c) — singleton catalog of services priced in CRC, with logPayment + 1-5 star ratings. Hub.safeTransferFrom handles the actual CRC transfer between humans. **Sourcify Exact Match verified** (Solidity 0.8.24).

- KittyFactory v1: [`0x21539cb2b5a80C88a0D05E631662972589bD010A`](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x21539cb2b5a80C88a0D05E631662972589bD010A) — free pot only, no tontine.
- Built on Circles V2 Hub `0xc12C1E50ABB450d6205Ea2C3Fa861b3B834d13e8` + BaseGroupFactory `0xD0B5Bd9962197BEaC4cbA24244ec3587f19Bd06d`.

## Try it

Inside the Circles playground:

```

## Stack

- **Frontend** — Vite 6, React 19, Tailwind v4, react-router 7, viem 2.21
- **Wallet** — `@aboutcircles/miniapp-sdk` (host iframe) + Circles profile service for member names & avatars
- **Circles SDK posture** — every Hub V2 / wrappers / avatar op goes through `@aboutcircles/sdk-core`'s typed wrappers via our in-tree `MiniappRunner` (upstream PR ready, see Architecture). Our own contracts (`KittyGovernance`, `ServiceRegistry`) are the only places `tx-builders.ts` still encodes via viem.
- **Contracts** — Foundry, Solidity 0.8.24, 105 tests passing. The free-pot core passed a Trail of Bits review; the tontine + stake extensions and the ServiceRegistry are post-audit and live on top. ServiceRegistry is Sourcify Exact Match verified.
- **Hosting** — Coolify (Docker + Caddy)
